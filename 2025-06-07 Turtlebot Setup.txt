## 🔧 Objective
Setup TERISA turtlebot in Home Lab 

---

## 📋 Materials
- Turtlebot 4 
    - Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
    - Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
    - Release:	22.04
    - Codename:	jammy

- Laptop with Ubuntu 22.04
    -Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
    -Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
    -Release:	22.04
    -Codename:	jammy
- ROS Humble installed in both Turtlebot4 and Laptop. (Turtlebot has everything needed already installed) 
- micro HDMI to HDMI cable
- USB wired keyboard
- HDMI monitor

---

## 🧪 Procedure
0. Follow https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/overview/
1. Connect Turtlebot and Monitor via micro HDMI to HDMI cable. ( Ethernet and C-Port acces were tried with no sucess ) 
2. Connect wired keyboard with Turtlebot.
3. Boot Turtlebot.
4. User : Ubuntu
5. Password : turtlebot4
6. Turtlebot setup to set network connection. 
7. * if Turtlebot is being used in a new network it will be better to setup the network in advance thru ssh

## 🧾 Observations

- We are using Simple Discover
- Fast DDS is the one compatible with ROS Humble
- If turtlebot is goint to be accessed thru a new computer it will be better to use a new ROS node.
    export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
    export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0 --> USE A NEW ROS ID. Currently in home lab node 42 is the one used. 

Also it will important to review fastdds.xml file (nano ~/.ros/fastdds.xml) to update IP address of PC and Turtlebot **** THIS IS BEING REMOVED with no harm due to parsin errors. 
Home lab : 
        Turtlebot 192.168.100.214
        PC 192.168.100.250

Test NETWORK communication betwen PC and turtlebot first with 

In Turtlebot: 
Ping 192.168.100.250
In PC:
Ping 192.168.100.214

Test ROS communication betwen PC and turtlebot first with 

In Turtlebot: 
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
In PC:
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener

## 🧾 Manually Deactivate Conda Environment Before ROS 2

If you're already in (base) and just want to leave it for now:

conda deactivate

Then run:

In Robot ssh : 
ros2 launch turtlebot4_bringup standard.launch.py

In a PC ssh : rose 
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard

Everything starts workikng when : 
1. in CReate app ( by accesing http://192.168.100.214:8080 ) also link ROS2 ID domain
2. Update ROS2 in Robot
3. Connect Robot and PC to the 5G Wifi

## 🧠 Next Steps
-  Continue with setup and interact with Robot .
